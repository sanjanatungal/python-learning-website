            <h2>What is File I/O?</h2>
            <p><strong>File I/O</strong> (Input/Output) in Python refers to working with files for reading data from them or writing data to them. Python provides built-in functions to handle files easily.</p>

            <h3>Opening a File</h3>
            <p>To open a file in Python, you use the <code>open()</code> function. You can specify the mode you want to open the file in, such as <code>"r"</code> for reading, <code>"w"</code> for writing, or <code>"a"</code> for appending.</p>
            <pre><code>file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Opens a file for reading</code></pre>

            <h3>Reading from a File</h3>
            <p>Once a file is opened in read mode, you can use the <code>read()</code>, <code>readline()</code>, or <code>readlines()</code> methods to read its contents.</p>
            <pre><code>content = file.read()  # Reads the entire file
print(content)</code></pre>

            <h3>Writing to a File</h3>
            <p>To write to a file, you open it in <code>"w"</code> mode, which will overwrite the file if it already exists. You can also use <code>"a"</code> mode to append to the file without overwriting.</p>
            <pre><code>file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Opens a file for writing
file.write("Hello, world!")  # Writes to the file
file.close()  # Closes the file</code></pre>

            <h3>Closing a File</h3>
            <p>It is essential to close a file after you are done with it to free up system resources. You can close a file using the <code>close()</code> method:</p>
            <pre><code>file.close()</code></pre>

            <h3>Using <code>with</code> for File Handling</h3>
            <p>The <code>with</code> statement is a better way to work with files, as it automatically handles closing the file:</p>
            <pre><code>with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)</code></pre>

            <h2>Exercise: Practice with File I/O</h2>
            <p>Try the following exercises to practice file handling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a file called <code>my_file.txt</code> and write some text to it.</li>
                <li>Open <code>my_file.txt</code> and read its contents, then print them to the console.</li>
                <li>Append a new line to <code>my_file.txt</code> and verify it was added by reading the file again.</li>
            </ul>
