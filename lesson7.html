            <h2>Why Small Projects?</h2>
            <p>Working on small projects helps you solidify your Python knowledge by applying the concepts you've learned. These projects will build confidence and give you practical coding experience.</p>

            <h3>Project 1: Number Guessing Game</h3>
            <p>Create a simple game where the computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it. Here's how to approach it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the <code>random</code> library to generate a random number.</li>
                <li>Prompt the player to input their guess.</li>
                <li>Give feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.</li>
                <li>Loop until the player guesses correctly or chooses to quit.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>import random
number = random.randint(1, 100)
guess = None
while guess != number:
    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
    if guess < number:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > number:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("You guessed it!")</code></pre>

            <h3>Project 2: Simple Calculator</h3>
            <p>Build a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask the user for two numbers and an operator.</li>
                <li>Perform the operation and display the result.</li>
                <li>Use functions for each operation for modularity.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y != 0:
        return x / y
    else:
        return "Cannot divide by zero!"</code></pre>

            <h3>Project 3: Word Frequency Counter</h3>
            <p>Write a program that reads a text file, counts the frequency of each word, and displays the results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use <code>with open()</code> to read the file.</li>
                <li>Use a dictionary to store word counts.</li>
                <li>Display the most frequent words in the text.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>word_count = {}
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        words = line.split()
        for word in words:
            word = word.lower().strip(",.!?")
            if word in word_count:
                word_count[word] += 1
            else:
                word_count[word] = 1
print(word_count)</code></pre>

            <h2>More Ideas to Try</h2>
            <p>If youâ€™re ready for a challenge, try building a To-Do List app, a Basic Quiz, or a Contact Book using dictionaries.</p>

            <h2>Next Lesson</h2>
            <p>We'll soon move into advanced topics, but for now, enjoy coding these mini-projects and see how much you've learned!</p>
